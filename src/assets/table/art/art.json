He was born as Omoba Taiwo Olaniyi Oyewale-Toyeje Oyekale Osuntoki to a father, Aitoyeje, who was a Muslim from Ibadan, and a mother, Mary, who was a Christian from Ogidi . The name by which he became known alludes to the fact that he was the only surviving child of seven sets of twins born to his mother. Twins Seven-Seven was an itinerant singer and dancer before he began his career as an artist, first attending in 1964 an Mbari Mbayo workshop conducted by Ulli Beier and Georgina Beier in Osogbo, a Yoruba town in southwestern Nigeria. He went on to become one of the best known artists of the Osogbo School . His work is influenced by traditional Yoruba mythology and culture, and creates a fantastic universe of humans, animals, plants and Yoruba gods. Visually, his work resembles Yoruba carvings in the segmentation, division and repetition of his compositions; conceptually, it reflects this influence in the emphasis on transformation and balance, as well as its embodiment of dualities such as the earthly and the spiritual, past and present, industry and agriculture . Early works such as Dreams of the Abiku Child (1967) make allusion to concepts or figures in Yoruba cosmology and mythology, such as the abiku (devil child), and the orisha Osun. However, Twins Seven Seven also described his work as \"contemporary Yoruba traditional art,\" not only paying homage to the influence of his cultural background but also to noting his responsiveness to current events and the postcolonial experience.

Other artists who contributed to Arturo included Joaquín Torres García , Piet Mondrian , and Wassily Kandinsky . In 1945 Edgar Bayley labeled the Argentine response to the European Concrete art movement invencionismo. This same group of artists that Bayley identified would later become the Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención art movement . In August 1946 Prati was one of the signatories of the Inventionist Manifesto that was published in the first edition of the groups magazine, Art Concreto. In line with the abstract, non-figurative leanings of the Concrete-Inventionists, Prati's paintings during this period were highly abstract, geometric, and colorful. Indeed, a key influence on her aesthetic style was the minimalist Piet Mondrian. She also experimented with shaped canvases. In 1950 she participated in the Arte Concreto exhibition at the Instituto De Arte Moderno in Buenos Aires . In 1952 Prati traveled to Europe. During this time she befriended the Swiss artist Max Bill , who was an early practitioner of European Concrete art. In 1952 Prati joined the Grupo de Artistas Modernos de la Argentina, a multi-disciplinary art movement, at the request of the Argentine poet Aldo Pellegrini. In 1952 Prati exhibited with the group in an exhibition entitled Grupo de Artistas Modernos de la Argentina that Pellegrini organized at the Viau Galería de Arte in Buenos Aires . In the mid-1950s, Prati abandoned painting in favor of graphic design, jewelry and textiles. In 1963 Prati not only took part in but also designed the exhibition poster for 20 Años de Arte Concreto (or \"20 Years of Concrete Art\") at the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art. In 1970 Prati co-founded the magazine Artinf with the artists Germaine Derbecq, Silvia de Ambrosini, and Odile Baron Supervielle. Prati died in Buenos Aires in 2008",

Her mother had aspirations of Amos studying with Hale Woodruff , but he did not accept many private students and left the area before she had the opportunity to study with him. At eleven, Amos took a course at Morris Brown College, where she worked on her draftsmanship and took note of the work that African American college students were producing at the time. By high school, Amos was submitting her work to Atlanta University art shows. She graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta at the age of 16, and applied to Antioch College, because of their progressive policies . Her father exposed her to black intelligentsia; Zora Neale Hurston frequently visited and W.E.B. Du Bois once called on the family.

During his time in Lugano, he also met Nando Tamberlani, noted set designer who would introduce him to the world of theater. In 1931, due to the impact of the Great Depression in Europe, Dr. Wendland sent the boy back to his mother in Mexico City. Back home he started doing sketches for set designs and writing plays influenced by Mr. Tamberlani. Two years later he started working in a local theater production company run by Fernando Wagner . In 1935 he was offered a scholarship to study at the Cleveland Play House where he made more than 50 set designs over the course of four years.

In 1950 Chillida married Pilar Belzunce and later returned to the San Sebastián area, first to the nearby village of Hernani and in 1959 to the city of his birth, where he remained. He died at his home near San Sebastián at the age of 78 . Chillida's sculptures concentrated on the human form (mostly torsos and busts); his later works tended to be more massive and more abstract, and included many monumental public works. Chillida himself tended to reject the label of \"abstract\", preferring instead to call himself a \"realist sculptor\". Upon returning to the Basque Country in 1951, Chillida soon abandoned the plaster he used in his Paris works – a medium suited to his study of archaic figurative works in the Louvre . Living near Hernani, he began to work in forged iron with the help of the local blacksmith, and soon set up a forge in his studio. From 1954 until 1966, Chillida worked on a series entitled Anvil of Dreams, in which he used wood for the first time as a base from which the metal forms rise up in explosive rhythmic curves. He began to make sculpture in alabaster 1965. Rather than turn over a maquette of a sculpture to fabricators, as many modern artists do, Chillida worked closely with the men in the foundry",
